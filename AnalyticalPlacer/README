For running the code, please:
1) Change directory to the source folder "a2".
2) Type "make" to compaile the code.
3) Type "./placer" to run the code.
4) Type the designated file name on the command window, such as "cct1.txt".
5) Type the specified number to run the program under different modes:
   [1] Spread with default parameters
   [2] Solve the initial placement only (for section 1)
   [3] Spread with linearly increased PSI (for section 2i)
   [4] Spread with reversed order of bins (for section 2ii)
   [5] Spread with strong anchor weights (for section 2iii)
   [6] Spread with weak anchor weights (for section 2iii)
   [7] Spread with strong anchor weights and reversed order of bins
   [8] Spread with weak anchor weights and reversed order of bins
6) The graph will be generated automatically. Press "Proceed" button to 
   continuelly spread the circuit until it converged.
7) Type "make clean" to clean up the folder.
